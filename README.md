# keras-rnn-demo
A very brief tutorial that uses Keras to build a Recurrent Neural Network Language Model.

You can view the HTML only or the Jupyter Python notebook. To run the code in the notebook, you'll need [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [Spacy](https://spacy.io/). Spacy is just used for pre-processing (tokenization), not the model itself; I included it because I really like it. You can comment out the block that uses it and substitute your own tokenizer.
