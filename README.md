# keras-rnn-demo
A brief tutorial that uses Keras to build a basic Recurrent Neural Network Language Model and uses it to generate story text.

To run the code in the notebook, you'll need [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
