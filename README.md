# keras-rnn-demo
A brief tutorial that uses Keras to build a basic Recurrent Neural Network Language Model.

You can view the HTML only or the Jupyter Python notebook. To run the code in the notebook, you'll need [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
