    "We'll build an RNN with four layers: \n",
    "1. An input layer that converts word indices into distributed vector representations (embeddings).\n",
    "2. A recurrent hidden layer, the main component of the network. As it observes each word in the story, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the story at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - I use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer.\n",
    "3. A second recurrent layer that takes the first as input and operates the same way, since adding more layers generally improves the model.\n",
    "3. A prediction (dense) layer that outputs a probability for each word in the lexicon via the softmax function, where each probability indicates the chance of that word being the next word in the sequence. The model gets feedback during training about what the actual word should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this is a very simplified explanation of the model, since the focus here is on how to implement it in Keras. For a more thorough explanation of RNNs, see the resources at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each layer, we need to specify the number of dimensions (units). For the embedding and recurrent layers, this number can be freely defined (it is typically between 50-1000). For the output (prediction) layer, the number of units is equal to the lexicon size, since the model computes a probability distribution for each word in the lexicon. To account for the zeros in the input, we'll add one more dimension so that each word index corresponds to its output dimension, i.e. the predicted probability of word index 1 is at column index 1 (2nd column) in the probability distribution output.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up the model, we specify the number of stories in each input batch (batch size) as well as the number of words in each story (n_timesteps). Here, we'll set n_timesteps to be the length of the x and y matrices above.\\**  So the shape of the input to the model is (batch_size, n_timesteps). The embedding layer needs to be told how many unique word indices there are (input_dim=lexicon size + 1, adding one since the 0 index is reserved for padding) so that it can map each word to a vector of size output_dim=n_embedding_nodes. Thus the shape of the embedding layer output will be (batch_size, n_timesteps, n_embedding_nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recurrent layers, return_sequences=True indicates the hidden state for each word in the story will be returned, as opposed to just the hidden state for the last word. This is necessary for the model to provide an output for each word. The stateful=True setting indicates the RNN will \"remember\" its hidden state until it is explicitly told to forget it via the reset_states() function. This comes into play during the generation stage (or also when n_timesteps is less than the length of x and y\\**), so I will explain this further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each word in a story, the prediction layer will output a probability distribution for the next word. To get this sequence of probability distributions rather than just one, we wrap TimeDistributed() class around the Dense layer. The model is trained to maximize the probabilities of the words in the stories, which is what the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function does (again, see below for a full explanation of this). \n",
    "\n",
    "One huge benefit of Keras is that it has several optimization algorithms already implemented. I use Adam here, there are several other available including SGD, RMSprop, and Adagrad. You can change other parameters like learning rate and gradient clipping as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\\**It is also possible to set n_timesteps to be less than this length and iterate over shorter sequences of words. For example, if we set n_timesteps to 10, the model will slide over each window of 10 words in the stories and perform an update to the parmaters by backpropogating the gradient over these 10 words (for the details of backpropogation, see below). However, we still want the model to \"remember\" everything in the story, not just the previous 10 words, so Keras provides the \"stateful\" option to do this. By setting \"stateful=True\" (here is it False), the hidden state of the model after observing 10 words will be carried over to the next word window. After all the words in a batch of stories have been processed, the reset_states() function can be called to indicate the model should now forget its hidden state and start over with the next batch of stories. You'd need to update the training function below to iterate through a batch of stories by n_timesteps at a time.*"
