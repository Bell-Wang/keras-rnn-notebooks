    "# A simple recurrent neural network language model with Keras\n",
    "by Melissa Roemmele, 4/28/17, roemmele @ ict.usc.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras is a Python deep learning framework built on top of Theano, a library for fast math. It lets you put together models with a minimal amount of code, depending on what type of neural network you want to build. It also makes it easy to run models on a GPU. It is easiest to install it with pip (\"pip install Keras\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras' documentation isn't bad, but I learned Theano before using Keras. If you have the time, I highly recommend doing a [tutorial on Theano](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/index.html) just to get a basic sense of how it works. I felt like I understood neural networks better just from doing the logistic regression and multlilayer perceptron tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I am going to show how to use Keras to create a language model using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The  input to the network is a set of word sequences and the output is a set of probabilities, which can then be used to predict new sequences."

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's a bunch of text sequences that we'll use as input to the RNN. If you're curious, these are a sample from a new dataset, [ROCStories](http://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/). The dataset consists of thousands of five-sentence stories, where the task is to predict the final sentence in each story given two choices. Here we'll use the model to generate the final sentence in each of these stories. There are only 100 stories here, which is tiny, but this is for demo purposes. Each story is already divided into a list of sentences."

So first we need to tokenize each of the stories into (lowercased) individual words. I'll use Keras' built-in tokenizer here for convenience, but typically I like to use the [spacy](https://spacy.io/) library. It does a whole lot more than tokenization (e.g. POS tagging, parsing, semantic indexing, etc.), and it's fast and has a really clean API. Keras' tokenizer does not do the same linguistic processing to separate punctuation from words, for instance, which should be their own tokens. You can see this below from words that end in punctuation like \".\" or \",\".\n",

Here, because this dataset is small, every word encountered in the stories is added to the lexicon."

    "### Now that the model is trained, it can be used to predict sentences. We will take some stories, give the model their first four sentences, and have it output the probability of the first word in the fifth sentence. Then we select the word with the highest probability and add it to the sequence. Alternatively, you can generate the next word through random sampling from the probability distribution (specify mode='random' instead of mode='max'). In either case, I repeat this process, each time predicting the next word based on the sequence so far. We stop generating words either when a maximum limit of words is reached (here, 20) or a token with an end-of-sentence marker is generated (e.g. \".\")."

Because Theano is compiled, you can't easily step through the network during training and view the values of intermediate layers in the model. Theano lets you run in test mode before the model is compiled, so you can see the results of each function. But as far as I can tell Keras doesn't provide anything special in the way of debugging."
