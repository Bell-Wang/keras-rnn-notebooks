    "# A simple recurrent neural network language model with Keras\n",
    "by Melissa Roemmele, 4/28/17, roemmele @ ict.usc.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras is a Python deep learning framework built on top of Theano, a library for fast math. It lets you put together models with a minimal amount of code, depending on what type of neural network you want to build. Also makes it easy to run models on a GPU. Easy installation with pip (\"pip install Keras\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras' documentation isn't bad, but I learned Theano before using Keras. If you have the time, I highly recommend doing a [tutorial on Theano](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/index.html) just to get a basic sense of how it works. I felt like I understood neural networks better just from doing the logistic regression and multlilayer perceptron tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I am going to show how to use Keras to create a language model using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The  input to the network is a bunch of word sequences and the output is a bunch of probabilities, which can then be used to predict new sequences."

    "## Stuff I've Found Helpful for Understanding/Implementing RNNs \n",
    "#### (this is biased to learning RNNs specifically for text data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Among the [Theano tutorials](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/) mentioned above, there are two specifically on RNNs for NLP: [semantic parsing](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnslu.html#rnnslu) and [sentiment analysis](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html#lstm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) (same model as shown here, with raw Python code) \n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow also has an RNN language model [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/recurrent/index.html) using the Penn Treebank dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### This [explanation](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) of how LSTMs work and why they are better than plain RNNs (this explanation also applies to the GRU used here)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another [tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/) that documents well both the theory of RNNs and their implementation in Python (and if you care to implement the details of the stochastic gradient descent and backprogation through time algorithms, which I do not, this is very helpful)"
