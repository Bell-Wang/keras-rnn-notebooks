# lm_probability
Code that loads a Keras Recurrent Neural Network language model and uses it to compute a probability score for a sequence. You can download the trained model [generation_rnn_96000.h5](http://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/) and accompanying tokenizer [tokenizer_96000.pkl](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6gWqMAiVWPXVXBPOG1EbG42d0E) referenced in the code, which were trained on 96,0000 stories in the [ROCStories](http://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/) corpus. See the main page for how to train your own model.
