    "I am going to show how to use the Keras library to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that predicts sentiment ratings for text sequences. Specifically, the model will predict the ratings associated with movie reviews.\n",

    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Recurrent Neural Networks</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a general framework for modeling sequence data and are particularly useful for natural language processing tasks. At a high level, RNN encode sequences via a set of parameters (weights) that are optimized to predict some output variable. The notebook demonstrates the code needed to assemble an RNN model using the Keras library, as well as some data processing tools that facilitate building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand how to structure the input and output of the model, and know the fundamental concepts in machine learning, then a high-level understanding of how an RNN works is sufficient for using Keras. You'll see that most of the code here is actually just data manipulation, and I'll visualize each step in this process. The code used to assemble the RNN itself is more minimal. It is of course useful to know these details, so you can theorize on the results and innovate the model to make it better. For a better understanding of RNNs and neural networks in general, see the resources at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here an RNN will be used to encode the text of a movie review, and this representation will be used to predict the numerical rating assigned by the reviewer. The model shown here can be applied to any task where the goal is to predict a numerical score associated with a piece of text. Hopefully you can substitute your own datasets and/or modify the code to adapt it to other tasks.\n",

    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a Python deep learning framework that lets you quickly put together neural network models with a minimal amount of code. It can be run on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) without you needing to know either of these underlying frameworks. It provides implementations of several of the layer architectures, objective functions, and optimization algorithms you need for building a model."

The ratings are on a 1-10 scale, but the dataset only contains \"polarized\" reviews: positive reviews with a rating of 7 or higher, and negative reviews with a rating of 4 or lower. There are an equal number of positive and negative reviews. In the full dataset, the reviews are divided into train and test sets with 25,000 reviews each. Here I'm going to load a sample training set of 100 reviews, so you can download the full dataset at the above link."

However, each review has a different number of words, so we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest review in the training set. For all reviews with fewer words, we prepend the row with zeros representing an empty word position. We can tell Keras to ignore these zeros during training."

    "To assemble the model, we'll use Keras' [Functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/), which is one of two ways to use Keras to assemble models (the alternative is the [Sequential API](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/), which is a bit simpler but has more constraints). A model consists of a series of layers. As shown in the code below, we initialize instances for each layer. Each layer can be called with another layer as input, e.g. Embedding()(input_layer). A model instance is initialized with the Model() object, which defines the initial input and final output layers for that model. Before the model can be trained, the compile() function must be called with the loss function and optimization algorithm specified (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Layers</font>\n",

    "We'll build an RNN with four layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Input**: The input layer takes in the matrix of word indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Embedding**: A [layer](https://keras.io/layers/embeddings/) that converts integer word indices into distributed vector representations (embeddings). The mask_zero=True parameter indicates that values of 0 in the matrix (the padding) will be ignored by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. GRU**: A [recurrent (GRU) hidden layer](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/), the central component of the model. As it observes each word in the story, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the review at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - I use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer (see the materials at the bottom for an explanation of the difference). This layer outputs the last hidden state of the sequence (i.e. the hidden representation of the review after its last word is observed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Dense**: An output [layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense) that predicts the rating for the review based on its GRU representation given by the previous layer. This output is continuous (i.e. ranging from 1-10) rather than categorical. The model gets feedback during training about what the actual rating should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"layer\" is just an abstraction, when really all these layers are just matrices. The \"weights\" that connect the layers are also matrices. The process of training a neural network is a series of matrix multiplications. The weight matrices are the values that are adjusted during training in order for the model to learn to predict ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Parameters</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our function for creating the model takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_input_nodes**: the number of unique words in the lexicon, plus one to account for the padding represented by 0 values. This indicates the number of rows in the embedding layer, where each row corresponds to a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_embedding_nodes**: the number of dimensions (units) in the embedding layer, which can be freely defined. Here, it is set to 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_hidden_nodes**: the number of dimensions in the hidden layers. Like the embedding layer, this can be freely chosen. Here, it is set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Procedure</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the model is a single continuous value (the predicted rating), making this a regression rather than a classification model. There is only one dimension in the output layer, which contains the predicted rating. Like all neural networks, RNNs learn by updating the parameters (weights) to optimize an objective (loss) function. For this model, the objective is to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings for the training reviews, thus bringing the predicted ratings closer to the real ratings. The details of this process are extensive; see the resources at the bottom of the notebook if you want a deeper understanding. One huge benefit of Keras is that it implements many of these details for you. Not only does it already have implementations of the types of layer architectures, it also has many of the [loss functions](https://keras.io/losses/) and [optimization methods](https://keras.io/optimizers/) you need for training various models."

Keras' Functional API lets you derive a new model with the layers from an existing model, so you can define the output to be a layer below the output layer in the original model. Calling predict() on this new model will produce the output of that layer for a given input. Of course, glancing at the numbers by themselves doesn't provide any interpretation of what the model has learned (although there are opportunities to [interpret these values](https://www.civisanalytics.com/blog/interpreting-visualizing-neural-networks-text-processing/)), but seeing them verifies the model is just a series of transformations from one matrix to another. The model stores its layers as the list model.layers, and you can retrieve specific layer by its position index in the model."

    "As mentioned above, the model shown here could be applied to any task where the goal is to predict a score for a particular sequence. For ratings prediction, this score is ordinal, but it could also be categorical with a few simple changes to the output layer of the model. My other notebooks for [language modeling/generation](https://github.com/roemmele/keras-rnn-demo/language-modeling) and [part-of-speech tagging](https://github.com/roemmele/keras-rnn-demo/pos-tagging) demonstrate this type of prediction with categorical variables. They also show how to build an RNN in Keras when the output is a sequence of labels, rather than a single value as shown here."
